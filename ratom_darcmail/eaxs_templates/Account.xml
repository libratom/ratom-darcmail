<!--# 
This template represents the EAXS <Account> element.
It is related to the lib.account_object.AccountObject module.

Note: this template (and the others) all have leading whitespace that matches what their indentation
should be within the context of a rendered EAXS XML file. While indentation isn't required, it's
a good idea to try for fairly well-indented XML.

Note: the custom "cdata" filter is used as needed to wrap the data in a CDATA block.

Note: avoid placing Jinja2 comments on the same line as an element that needs to be rendered because
that can create issues: i.e. line breaks will be missing, making the XML harder to read. It might be
best to also avoid writing XML comments (which will be rendered in the output) on the same line of
and element that needs to be rendered.

    In other words:

        # Put Jinja2 or XML comments here.
        <myElement>{{ some_object }}</myElement>
        # Or here.
        <myElement>{{ some_object }}</myElement> # But not here.
    
TODO: 
    * Add EAXS XSD URI back to XML header. Remember: It's still on GitHub!
