<!--# 
This template represents the EAXS <Account> element. It is related to the 
lib.account_object.AccountObject module. It includes other templates to form a complete EAXS 
template representation.

Note: This template (and the others) all have leading whitespace that matches what their indentation
should be within the context of a rendered EAXS XML file. While indentation isn't required, it's
a good idea to try for fairly well-indented XML.

Note: Avoid placing Jinja2 comments or XML comments on the same line as something that will be 
renderered. In other words:

    # Put Jinja2 or XML comments here.
    <myElement>{{ some_object }}</myElement>
    # Or here.
    <myElement>{{ some_object }}</myElement> # But not here.
    
TODO: 
    * Add EAXS XSD URI back to XML header. Remember: It's still on GitHub and that's not great!
    * Put these templates in a subfolder "/eaxs_v1".
    * Work on first-level indents in all templates since you're now using an indent filter on 
    "include".
    * The EAXS schema seems to explicitly say when to use CDATA; TOMES DarcMail seems to use CDATA 
    blocks more liberally. This might be a problem that shouldn't get replicated here. So check
    when you should/shouldn't use CDATA. The "cdata" filter can be made to export CDATA only when
    needed.
    * Filters notation: DO: "l |reverse" NOT: "l | reverse".
    * It might be easier to read if all vars you create inside template are CAPS.
